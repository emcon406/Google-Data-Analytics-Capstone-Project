# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project:
### How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

# Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. 
The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 
Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# Purpose
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# Characters and Teams
- **Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
- **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for
the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
These may include email, social media, and other channels.
- **Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for
collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclisticâ€™s
mission and business goalsâ€”as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help
Cyclistic achieve them.
- **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide
whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

# Data Sources
Cyclisticâ€™s historical [trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) was provided through the Google Data Analytics, available through Motive International Inc. under [this](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) license. It is a clean public data source, in .csv format, with no outliers that gives several years of data about how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
